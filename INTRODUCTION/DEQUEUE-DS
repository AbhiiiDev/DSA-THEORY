A deque can be thought of as an array of items, but with one important difference: Instead of pushing and popping items off
the end to make room, deques are designed to allow items to be inserted at either end. This property makes deques well-suited 
for performing tasks such as keeping track of inventory, scheduling tasks, or handling large amounts of data.


There are two types of deque:

1. put Restricted Deque: Insertion operations are performed at only one end while deletion is performed at both ends in the input restricted queue.

2. put Restricted Deque: Deletion operations are performed at only one end while insertion is performed at both ends in the output restricted queue.

Following are some real-time applications for deque data structure: 

It can be used as both stack and queue, as it supports all the operations for both data structures.
