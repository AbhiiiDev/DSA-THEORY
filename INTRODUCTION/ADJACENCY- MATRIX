Adjacency Matrix is a two-dimensional array with the dimensions V x V, where V is the number of vertices in a graph. 
Representation is simpler to implement and adhere to. It takes O(1) time to remove an edge.
Queries such as whether there is an edge from vertex 'u' to vertex 'v' are efficient and can be completed in O(1).


One of the cons of this representation is that even if the graph is sparse (has fewer edges), it takes up the same amount of space. 
Adding a vertex takes O(V^2). It also takes O(V) time to compute all of a vertex's neighbours, 
which is not very efficient.Adjacency Matrix is a two-dimensional array with the dimensions V x V, where V is the number of vertices in a graph.
