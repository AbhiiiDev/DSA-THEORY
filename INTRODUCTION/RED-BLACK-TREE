Red Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Rudolf Bayer invented it in 1972 and dubbed it "symmetric binary B-trees."

A red-black tree is a Binary tree in which each node has a colour attribute, either red or black. By comparing the node colours on any simple path from the root to a leaf, red-black trees ensure that no path is more than twice as long as any other, ensuring that the tree is generally balanced.

Red-black trees are similar to binary trees in that they both store their data in two's complementary binary formats. However, red-black trees have one important advantage over binary trees: they are faster to access. Because red-black trees are so fast to access, they are often used to store large amounts of data.

Red-black trees can be used to store any type of data that can be represented as a set of values.
