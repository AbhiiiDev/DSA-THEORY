A data structure is linear if all its elements or data items are arranged in a sequence or a linear order. 
The elements are stored in a non-hierarchical way so that each item has successors and predecessors except the first and 
last element in the list.

Examples of linear data structures are Arrays, Stack, Strings, Queue, and Linked List.
