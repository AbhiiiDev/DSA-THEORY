1. push: This adds an item to the top of the stack. The overflow condition occurs if the stack is full.
2. pop: This removes the top item of the stack. Underflow condition occurs if the stack is empty.
3. top: This returns the top item from the stack.
4. Empty: This returns true if the stack is empty else false.
