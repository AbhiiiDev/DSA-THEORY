The following are the types of data structures:

Lists: A collection of related things linked to the previous or/and following data items.
Arrays: A collection of values that are all the same.
Records: A collection of fields, each of which contains data from a single data type.
Trees: A data structure that organizes data in a hierarchical framework. This form of data structure follows the ordered order of data item insertion, deletion, and modification.
Tables: The data is saved in the form of rows and columns. These are comparable to records in that the outcome or alteration of data is mirrored across the whole table.
