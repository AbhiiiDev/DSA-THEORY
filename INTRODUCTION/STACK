A stack is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure, as in a real physical stack or piles where
you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things. Thus, insertion (push) and deletion (pop) of items 
take place only at one end called top of the stack, with a particular order: LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).
