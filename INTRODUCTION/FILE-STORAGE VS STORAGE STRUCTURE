File Structure: Representation of data into secondary or auxiliary memory say any device
such as a hard disk or pen drives that stores data which remains intact until manually deleted is known as a file structure representation.
Storage Structure: In this type, data is stored in the main memory i.e RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses this data 
gets completely executed.
The difference is that the storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer system,
whereas the file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory
