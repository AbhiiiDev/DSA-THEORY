                  Arrays	                                                                                         Linked Lists                                     
An array is a collection of data elements of the same type.	                             A linked list is a collection of entities known as nodes. The node is divided into two sections: data and address.
It keeps the data elements in a single memory.	                                         It stores elements at random, or anywhere in the memory.
The memory size of an array is fixed and cannot be changed during runtime.              	The memory size of a linked list is allocated during runtime.
An array's elements are not dependent on one another.	                                  Linked List elements are dependent on one another.
It is easier and faster to access an element in an array.                               	In the linked list, it takes time to access an element.
Memory utilization is ineffective in the case of an array.                              	Memory utilization is effective in the case of an array.
Operations like insertion and deletion take longer time in an array.                  	Operations like insertion and deletion are faster in the linked list.
